# KotlinHelpers

This library provides functionality that is missing in the default Kotlin libraries.

Main features:
- `binarySearch`: Binary search for functions of integer and float types.
- `collectionTools`: Efficient tools for working with collections, such as crossing (cartesian product), 
permutations, combinations, subsets, and more.
- `DefaultHashMap`: Map with default values for missing keys.
- `IterableTools`: Tools for working with iterables, such `averageOf`, `variance`, `valueCounts`, and more.
- `NumberTools`: Tools for working with numbers, such as mean calculation between any integers (no overflow problems)

Extremely helpful are the *crossing* functions for cartesian products, and the *select* functions for permutations, combinations, etc..
